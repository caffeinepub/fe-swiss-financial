  "summary": "Build a CRM application for a Swiss financial advisory firm (FE Swiss Financial) with a Swiss-style minimalist UI, including a rebuilt sidebar navigation (Dashboard, Clients, Onboarding, KYC Screening, Reports, Settings), dashboard analytics, client list management (with Add New Client CTA on Clients page), detailed client profiles, onboarding kanban pipeline, KYC screening management with manual check entry, and compliance reporting views.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Add role/permission concept (at minimum: admin) and an initialization/bootstrap rule to assign admin to the first created record.",
    "Update IA/navigation: sidebar contains Dashboard, Clients, Onboarding, KYC Screening, Reports, Settings (Settings pinned near bottom before user profile); 'Add New Client' is a primary CTA on Clients page, not a sidebar item.",
    "Sidebar nav grouping: Dashboard/Clients/Onboarding/KYC Screening/Reports, then a separator, then Settings pinned just above the user profile/logout section; ensure main content layout accounts for sidebar width (no overlap).",
    "Client Detail page redesign: include a top alert bar for compliance warnings, a profile header with client ID format like HEL-2026-0001 and Edit/Download PDF actions, and a tabbed layout (Overview default + Identity & KYC, Documents, Financial Profile, Connections, Activity Log, Notes).",
    "Identity & KYC tab UI spec: Identity Documents displayed as cards; expiry countdown color thresholds (green >90d, orange 30–90d, red <30d/expired) + verified badge/date; KYC Screening History rendered as a table; Current Risk Assessment card includes Initiate New Screening CTA; populate with Swiss-oriented mock data (e.g., Swiss passport, B permit).",
    "Clients page layout: main content must be offset to the right of the ~220px sidebar so page title and search UI never overlap/cut off.",
    "Clients page header should include a prominent \"Add Client\" CTA aligned top-right next to the page title, navigating to the Add Client form route.",
    "Clients table should render 5 realistic Swiss mock client rows when backend data is unavailable to avoid empty-state table (names, status, risk, nationality, onboarding dates).",
    "Add Client form spec: sections Contact Details + Personal Data; First/Last required; Account ID auto-generated in format FES-YYYY-NNNN (e.g., FES-2026-0001); default Client Type=Individual with option Entity.",
    "Create Client flow: attempt backend canister save then navigate to Clients list; on failure, persist locally (fallback) and still navigate/show in list."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Sidebar overlaps main content; main content area needs proper left margin/padding to account for sidebar width.",
    "Clients page content is still partially hidden under the left sidebar (insufficient left margin/padding).",
    "Add Client page: 'Create Client' button currently does nothing (no save/no navigation).",
    "Export PDF filename still incorrect: Caffeine platform overrides document/iframe titles even with iframe print approach; must stop using print-based flows and switch to direct jsPDF download to control filename.",
    "jsPDF-based Export PDF is not viable because the jsPDF library is not available in this project; revert to a popup-window print approach."
