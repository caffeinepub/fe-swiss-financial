REQ-50 cannot be fully verified from the truncated ClientDetailPage.tsx diff (the export handler/filename construction is not shown). Two additional files (frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json) were modified despite the request to keep changes scoped to pdfDownload.ts and ClientDetailPage.tsx.",

      "reason": "The provided diff for ClientDetailPage.tsx is truncated before the Export PDF action/handler, so there is no direct evidence that the filename is constructed as required and passed to downloadPDF.",
